image to which some filters chosen by the user from a filter bank have
been applied.
After the user loads an image, the filters are applied cumulatively 
when the user is prompted to type the first letter of their choice of
filter. The new modified image is displayed every time a new filter is 
applied and is only saved after the user props it to do so.
